# Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI)

This package includes MATLAB implementations for calculating Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI).

Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI)
---------------
**pmi.m** is a program for calculating PMI within a topic or topics. When A is a nonnegative matrix,

    pmi(A, Wtopk_idx, mcnt, epsilon)

returns a matrix of PMI values.
The four parameters are mandatory, and the details are as follows.

* `A`      -  Input matrix (m x n)
* `Wtopk_idx` -  Cell array containing matrix/matrices with indices for top keywords 
* `mcnt`  -  Number of models (e.g. Standard NMF, Sparse NMF, etc.)
* `epsilon`           -  Value for preventing log(0)

One usage example is provided in **example_pmi.m**.
